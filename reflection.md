- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance really makes a lot of programming easier. Rather than repeating yourself, you're saving your time and your computer's time by only writing the similar code in the parent class. Reviewing the lectures and doing the code-alongs in class helped me. I was able to have a better footing for this assignment. An issue I had was with .isAvailable of the Library class. For some reason, this.collection.containsKey(title) does not return true, even though the same code returns true in .containsTitle(title). I am confused about that, but did not have time to go to TA hours or office hours. I would advise getting help from your professors or classmates when you need it and to start early on the assignment.
